# Final Project
## Description

The final project is a Haskell project which takes "books" as .txt format and calculates a threshold to decide if it's a children's book or an adult book.
These thresholds include
- average number of commas in a sentence
- length of chapters
- length of sentences
- others

We need a minimum of 1500 sample books to calculate an accurate threshold.
